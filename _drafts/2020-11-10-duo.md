title: DUO Authentication Proxy

I recently had to add a second factor to an AWS Workspaces environment. We are using AWS Microsoft Directory Services for the Workspaces directory, which can be configured to call an external RADIUS server for secondary authentication. Since we are already using DUO for other systems, I used the [Duo Authentication Proxy](https://duo.com/docs/authproxy_reference) to provide this second factor.
