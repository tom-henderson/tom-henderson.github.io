title: Apple Watch 2 Year Review

I bought my apple watch in January 2017, and have worn it pretty much every day since. Initially I was slightly dissappointed, as the main reason I wanted an Apple watch was for running, and neither Strava or Spotify had watch apps. I tried Apple's run tracker using the workouts app. It works gret, but the data is locked into Apple's app and can't export to Strava. I also tried the Nike+ Run Club app, but there's no easy way to get that data into Strava either (there actually was, briefly, using a [sync tool made by Vincent Ghyssens](http://nike.vinz.xyz) but I found it pretty a bit hit and miss). At that point I decided to just try a bunch of apps, and ended up using Runkeeper for a while, with [tapiriik](https://tapiriik.com/) syncing the data to Strava. This worked (mostly) but the Runkeeper app was pretty buggy. At the time it had a pretty annoying bug where if you started a run on the watch, but the phone was in range, it would actually start tracking location using the phone. I got back from at least one run to discovere that according to Runkeeper I still hadn't left ಠ_ಠ. Finally Strava released their own app, and to begin with it was pretty awful. Since then it has improved massively, and I almost never have any issues with it.

What I like:
 - Strava.
 - Duo Notifications.

What I don't like:
 - Spotify.
 - Syncing music.
 - Complications.

As much as I love the tech side of the Apple watch, at the end of the day I found I was missing my real watches. I have a Rodina 'Enhanced' Automatic: a fairly cheap, chinese made, three-hand Bauhaus style watch in the style of a [Stowa Antea Klassik](https://www.stowa.de/en/Antea+Klassik+365.htm). I love wearing it.
