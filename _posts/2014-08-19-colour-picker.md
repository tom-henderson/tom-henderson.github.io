title: Colour Picker
---

Not sure why this isn't built in to OS X. [Colour Picker](https://github.com/tom-henderson/colour-picker) is a nice easy way to launch the system colour picker from spotlight or the dock. It's literally a 2 word AppleScript application:

```bash
choose color
```

I'd recommend using the icon from /Applications/Utilities/DigitalColor Meter.app.
