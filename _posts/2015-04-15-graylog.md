### Installing the Graylog Server

Graylog is a free log management platform that can collect log data from a wide range of sources. This post shows how to quickly set up a Graylog server and start monitoring logs from Linux and Windows hosts. For detailed documentation refer to the [Greylog Online Documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/index.html).

The quickest way to get started is to download the [Graylog OVA Appliance](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-images/tree/master/ova). This is imported into a new VM in your VMware environment. 

Once the appliance is up and running, log in to the console with username and password ``ubuntu``. We're going to update the admin password, email config and [timezone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones):

{% highlight bash %}
    sudo graylog-ctl set-admin-password <password>
    sudo graylog-ctl set-email-config <smtp server> --user=<username> --password=<password>
    sudo graylog-ctl set-timezone <zone acronym>
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
{% endhighlight %}

We'll also assign a static IP by editing ``/etc/network/interfaces``, and then reload the network and Graylog service:

{% highlight bash %}
    sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0
    sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, change the password for the ``ubuntu`` user on the VM with ``sudo passwd`` and log off.

You can now access the server on the IP address we set above and log in with username ``admin`` and the password you set earlier. You may want to add a DNS record for the new server at this point.

### Configure Inputs

Before we start sending log data to Graylog, we need to tell it what type of data we'll be sending. We do this by creatign two inputs: a ``Syslog UDP`` input for our Linux servers and a ``GELF UDP`` input for our Windows servers.

Click on System > Inputs, and select ``GELF UDP`` from the input menu. Click Launch new input. Turn on 'Global input', and give the input a name. All other settings can be left as their defaults. Repeat these steps to create another input, this time using the ``Syslog UDP`` type.

### Set up Clients

#### Linux

On our linux clients we'll configure rsyslog to forward log data to Graylog. Save the following config to ``/etc/rsyslog.d/90-graylog2.conf``, replacing ``syslog.example.com`` with the IP address or DNS name of the Graylog server:

{% gist dc9572a973003db18019 90-graylog2.conf %}

And restart rsyslog:

{% highlight bash %}
    sudo service rsyslog restart
{% endhighlight %}

#### Windows

On our Windows clients we need to install [NX Log Community Edition](http://nxlog.org/products/nxlog-community-edition/download) to export log data.

Once it's intalled, open up ``C:\Program Files (x86)\nxlog\conf\nxlog.conf`` and enter the following, replacing ``syslog.example.com`` with the IP address or DNS name of the Graylog server:    

{% gist dc9572a973003db18019 nxlog.conf %}

To apply the new config, reload the nxlog service.

### Viewing Logs

You should now be able to log in to your Graylog server and see log data coming in under the Sources tab.
