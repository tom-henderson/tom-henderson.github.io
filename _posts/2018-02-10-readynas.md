title: Setting up SNMPD on ReadyNAS Duo v1
comments: true

The [ReadyNas Duo v1](https://www.netgear.com/support/product/RND2000v1_(ReadyNAS_Duo_v1).aspx) is fairly old now, but is still perfectly capable of providing up to 2TB of shared RAID storage over gigabit ethernet. While it does offer email alerting, I'd prefer to add it to [Observium](http://www.observium.org/) with the rest of my lab, as that's where the rest of my monitoring is done. Turns out this is actually fairly easy to set up.

1. Power on with new drives and follow reset process.
2. Set up networking and connect to network.
3. Upgrade to latest firmware.
4. Install [Toggle SSH](http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/ReadyNAS/ADDON/4.1.3+/ToggleSSH_1.0.bin) patch
5. Install [Enable Root SSH](http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/ReadyNAS/ADDON/4.1.3+/EnableRootSSH_1.0.bin) patch
6. Install [APT](http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/ReadyNAS/ADDON/4.1.3+/APT_1.0.bin) patch
7. SSH to NAS `ssh root@nas-ip` using admin password
8. Install snmpd `apt-get install snmpd`
9. Configure snmpd.conf

{% highlight bash %}
rocommunity <secret>
syslocation Auckland, New Zealand
syscontact Tom Henderson
{% endhighlight %}

{:start="10"}
10. Restart snmpd service `/etc/init.d/snmpd restart`
11. You should now be able to connect to the NAS over SNMP
12. Finally we need to make sure snmpd starts if the system reboots, by running `ln -s ../init.d/snmpd /etc/rc3.d/S99smnp`
