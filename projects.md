## [Bookmarks](https://github.com/tom-henderson/bookmarks)

To replace my del.icio.us account I built a simple CRUD [bookmarks manager](https://bookmarks.thx.nz) in Django. It uses django-taggit for tagging and markdown for formatting the descriptions. I exported my existing bookmarks from del.icio.us, and imported them with a custom admin command.

## Shaky Isles Wholesale

Built with Django, this ordering platform integrates directly with the bakery's point-of-sale system, to batch process orders directly onto customer accounts. Customers can view and manage their orders, and view invoices online (or downlad in PDF format) as soon as the order is processed.

## Unifi Wireless Custom Guest Portal

A custom Django based authentication page for a UniFi WiFi captive portal. The appearance of the page can be customised for each location using the portal, and promotional images can be uploaded to the admin site.
