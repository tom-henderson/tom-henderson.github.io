# About

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Site Reliability Engineer working in Auckland, New Zealand. I work on our AWS, Windows, Linux and Docker infrastructure; CI/CD environments; observability tools, and various other cloudy things. Any opinions on this site are my own and not those of my employers.

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is a modified version of [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator).
